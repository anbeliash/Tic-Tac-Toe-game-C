# Tic-Tac-Toe-game-C

## Description
The game consists of a board: 8 rows and 8 columns. Initially, all 64 squares take the state: circle. As part of the game, the player is asked to choose a row and column number. After selecting, the state of a given field and four adjacent fields is changed to the opposite one (instead of a circle we put a cross, instead of a cross we put a circle). There is a limit on the number of steps that is entered initially. The game counts and displays the number of moves made. The game ends with a victory when all squares have a cross.
